# Orders-Profiles Linking Fix

## Problem Statement

The current system had a critical issue where orders were not properly linked to user profiles. Orders were being created with dummy customer data instead of real user information, making it impossible to track customer order history and maintain proper data relationships.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Dummy Data Usage**: Checkout page was using hardcoded dummy data (`'customer@example.com'`, `'9999999999'`)
2. **Missing Profile Fields**: Profiles table lacked email and phone fields for proper linking
3. **No Foreign Key Relationships**: Orders table had no foreign key constraints to link with profiles
4. **Inefficient Lookups**: Webhook was using inefficient queries to find user profiles
5. **Data Inconsistency**: Orders and profiles had different field names and formats

## Solution Overview

This fix implements a comprehensive solution to properly link orders with user profiles using email as the primary foreign key relationship.

### Key Changes:

1. **Database Schema Updates**:
   - Added email and phone fields to profiles table
   - Added canonical email/phone fields for consistent lookups
   - Created foreign key relationship between orders and profiles
   - Added database triggers for automatic field normalization

2. **Application Logic Updates**:
   - Updated checkout page to use real user profile data
   - Modified order creation API to populate customer fields from profiles
   - Enhanced Razorpay webhook to efficiently link orders with profiles
   - Added proper error handling and validation

3. **Data Migration**:
   - Created migration script to link existing orders with profiles
   - Added data normalization for existing records
   - Implemented verification queries to ensure data integrity

## Files Modified

### Database
- `supabase/migrations/20250824_fix_profiles_orders_linking.sql` - Main migration file

### Frontend
- `app/checkout/page.tsx` - Updated to use real user profile data

### Backend APIs
- `app/api/orders/route.ts` - Enhanced order creation with profile data
- `app/api/webhook/razorpay/route.ts` - Improved profile linking logic

### Scripts
- `scripts/run-migration.js` - Migration runner script

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Option 1: Using Supabase CLI (recommended)
supabase db push

# Option 2: Manual execution
# Copy the SQL from supabase/migrations/20250824_fix_profiles_orders_linking.sql
# and execute it in your Supabase SQL Editor
```

### Step 2: Deploy Code Changes

The updated files are ready to be deployed. The changes are backward-compatible and include proper error handling.

### Step 3: Verify Implementation

Run these verification queries in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check total orders and linking status
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_orders,
  COUNT(user_uid) as linked_orders,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(user_uid) as unlinked_orders
FROM public.orders;

-- Check for constraint violations
SELECT COUNT(*) as constraint_violations
FROM public.orders o
LEFT JOIN public.profiles p ON o.customer_email_canonical = p.email_canonical
WHERE o.customer_email_canonical IS NOT NULL AND p.email_canonical IS NULL;

-- View sample linked orders
SELECT
  o.id as order_id,
  o.customer_email,
  p.id as profile_id,
  p.email as profile_email
FROM public.orders o
JOIN public.profiles p ON o.customer_email_canonical = p.email_canonical
LIMIT 10;
```

### Step 4: Test the Flow

1. **User Registration**: Ensure users register with real email and phone
2. **Profile Completion**: Users should complete their profiles with accurate information
3. **Order Creation**: Test the checkout flow to ensure real data is used
4. **Webhook Processing**: Verify that Razorpay webhooks properly link orders to profiles

## Database Schema Changes

### Profiles Table
```sql
-- Added fields:
- email (text)
- email_canonical (text) -- Lowercase, trimmed version
- phone (text)
- phone_normalized (text) -- Digits only

-- Added constraints:
- UNIQUE on email_canonical
- UNIQUE on phone_normalized
```

### Orders Table
```sql
-- Added fields:
- customer_email_canonical (text)
- customer_phone_normalized (text)

-- Added foreign key:
- orders.customer_email_canonical -> profiles.email_canonical
```

### Triggers Added
- `handle_profile_email_canonical()` - Auto-populates canonical fields in profiles
- `handle_order_customer_canonical()` - Auto-populates canonical fields in orders

## API Changes

### Checkout Page (`app/checkout/page.tsx`)
- Now fetches user profile data before payment
- Uses real customer information instead of dummy data
- Fallback to session data if profile is incomplete

### Orders API (`app/api/orders/route.ts`)
- Fetches user profile data during order creation
- Populates customer_email and customer_phone from profile
- Maintains backward compatibility

### Razorpay Webhook (`app/api/webhook/razorpay/route.ts`)
- Enhanced user derivation logic using canonical fields
- More efficient profile lookups
- Better error handling and logging

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Proper foreign key relationships ensure data consistency
2. **Customer Tracking**: Ability to track complete order history per customer
3. **Better Analytics**: Accurate customer data for business intelligence
4. **Improved UX**: Users see their real information during checkout
5. **Scalability**: Efficient database queries with proper indexing
6. **Compliance**: Better data management for customer privacy regulations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

1. **Migration Fails with Constraint Violations**
   - Check for duplicate emails/phones in profiles table
   - Run cleanup queries before migration

2. **Orders Not Linking to Profiles**
   - Verify email canonicalization is working
   - Check that profiles have email_canonical populated
   - Ensure webhook is receiving correct customer data

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Verify indexes were created successfully
   - Check query execution plans for slow lookups

4. **Webhook Processing Errors**
   - Check Razorpay payload structure
   - Verify profile lookup logic
   - Monitor logs for derivation failures

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor:
- Percentage of orders linked to profiles
- Constraint violation errors
- Profile lookup success rate
- Order creation success rate

### Regular Maintenance:
- Monitor for orphaned orders (orders without profile links)
- Clean up duplicate profiles if any
- Update canonical fields for any data inconsistencies
- Review and optimize indexes as data grows

## Security Considerations

- All profile data access is properly secured with RLS policies
- Email canonicalization prevents case-sensitivity issues
- Phone normalization ensures consistent formatting
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Profile Fields**: Consider adding address, preferences, etc.
2. **Profile Completion Incentives**: Encourage users to complete profiles
3. **Data Validation**: Add stricter validation for email/phone formats
4. **Audit Logging**: Track profile changes for compliance
5. **Profile Sync**: Sync profile changes across all user sessions

## Support

If you encounter issues with this implementation:

1. Check the verification queries to identify specific problems
2. Review application logs for error messages
3. Ensure all migrations were applied successfully
4. Test with a fresh user account to isolate issues
